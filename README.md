This code solve the Einstein-Euler equations in Gowdy Symmetry. The fluid is evolved using the Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) shock capturing scheme 
while the Einstein equations can either be evolved with the KT scheme or standard finite differences. Time evolution is performed using standard Runge Kutta schemes. 

This code was used to produce the paper "Instability of Slowly Expanding FLRW Spacetimes" by Elliot Marshall. (arxiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08095)
