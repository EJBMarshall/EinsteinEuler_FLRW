This code solve the Einstein-Euler equations in Gowdy Symmetry. The fluid is evolved using the Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) shock capturing scheme 
while the Einstein equations can either be evolved with the KT scheme or standard finite differences. Time evolution is performed using standard Runge Kutta schemes.
